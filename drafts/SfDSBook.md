# Scala for Data Science [book review]

*This is the draft of a post that will eventually appear on my blog. I'll put the link here when I post. This is not the definitive version.*

This post will review the book:

* [Scala for Data Science](http://amzn.to/2hKGIz2), Bugnion, Packt, 2016.

*Disclaimer: This book review has not been solicited by the publisher (or anyone else) in any way. I purchased the review copy of this book myself. I have not received any benefit from writing this review.*

## Introduction

On this blog I previously reviewed the (terrible) book, [Scala for machine learning](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2015/04/09/scala-for-machine-learning-book-review/) by the same publisher. I was therefore rather wary of buying this book. But the topic coverage looked good, so decided to buy it and wasn't disappointed. Scala for Data Science is my top recommendation for getting started with statistical computing and data science applications using Scala.
