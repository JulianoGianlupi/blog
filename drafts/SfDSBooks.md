# Books on Scala for statistical computing and data science

*This is the draft of a post that will eventually appear on my blog. I'll put the link here when I post. This is not the definitive version.*

## Introduction

People regularly ask me about books and other resources for getting started with Scala for statistical computing and data science. This post will focus on books, but it's worth briefly noting that there are a number of other resources available, on-line and otherwise, that are also worth considering. I particularly like the Coursera course [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) - I still think this is probably the best way to get started with Scala and functional programming for most people. In fact, there is an entire [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) that is worth considering - I'll probably discuss that more in another post. I've got a draft page of [Scala links](https://github.com/darrenjw/djwhacks/blob/master/scala/ScalaLinks.md) which has a bias towards scientific and statistical computing, and I'm currently putting together a [short course](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-course) in that area, which I'll also discuss further in future posts. But this post will concentrate on books.

## Reading list

### Getting started with Scala

Before one can dive into statistical computing and data science using Scala, it's a good idea to understand a bit about the language and about functional programming. There are by now many books on Scala, and I haven't carefully reviewed all of them, but I've looked at enough to have an idea about good ways of getting started.

* [Programming in Scala: Third edition](http://amzn.to/2hWveXw), Odersky et al, Artima.
  * This is *the* Scala book, often referred to on-line as **PinS**. It is a weightly tome, and works through the Scala language in detail, starting from the basics. Every serious Scala programmer should own this book. However, it isn't the easiest introduction to the language.
* [Scala for the Impatient](http://amzn.to/2i4SW3f), Horstmann, Addison-Wesley.
  * As the name suggests, this is a much quicker and easier introduction to Scala than PinS, but assumes reasonable familiarity with programming in general, and sort-of assumes that the reader has a basic knowledge of Java and the JVM ecosystem. That said, it does not assume that the reader is a Java expert. My feeling is that for someone who has a reasonable programming background and a passing familiarity with Java, then this book is probably the best introduction to the language. Note that there is a second edition in the works.
