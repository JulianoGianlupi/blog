# Books on Scala for statistical computing and data science

*This is the draft of a post that will eventually appear on my blog. I'll put the link here when I post. This is not the definitive version.*

## Introduction

People regularly ask me about books and other resources for getting started with Scala for statistical computing and data science. This post will focus on books, but it's worth briefly noting that there are a number of other resources available, on-line and otherwise, that are also worth considering. I particularly like the Coursera course [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) - I still think this is probably the best way to get started with Scala and functional programming for most people. In fact, there is an entire [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) that is worth considering - I'll probably discuss that more in another post. I've got a draft page of [Scala links](https://github.com/darrenjw/djwhacks/blob/master/scala/ScalaLinks.md) which has a bias towards scientific and statistical computing, and I'm currently putting together a [short course](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-course) in that area, which I'll also discuss further in future posts. But this post will concentrate on books.
